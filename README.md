Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to predict whether a person has diabetes or not based on medical data. 
The model is trained using the PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset. The primary objective is to accurately classify patients as diabetic 
or non-diabetic using various features such as glucose levels, insulin, BMI, and age.
